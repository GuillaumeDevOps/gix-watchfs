Filesystem watcher

For now, it only logs the changes in the file.
More features to be added soon.

## Usage

The below command will watch folder/files (passed as command line argument) and log the changes.
```sh
watchfs folder
```

## TODO

[ ] Run custom command on folder change
[ ] Watch all files/folders given through regex
[ ] Ignore changes to files specified through command line argument
